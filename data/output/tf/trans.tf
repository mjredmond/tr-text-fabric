12386	Ephesus
12387	[when] I was going

12390	so that
12391	you might warn
12392	certain men
12393	not
12394	to teach other doctrines

12417	love
12418	out of

12422	a conscience
12423	good
12424	and
12425	a faith
12426	sincere
12427	from which
12428	some
12429	having missed the mark
12430	have turned aside
12431	to
12432	meaningless discourse
12433	desiring
12434	to be
12435	teachers of the Law
12436	not
12437	understanding
12438	neither
12439	what
12440	they are saying
12441	nor
12442	[that] about
12443	which
12444	they confidently assert
12445	We know
12446	now
12447	that
12448	good [is]
12449	the

12463	for [the] lawless
12464	however

12470	for [the] unholy
12471	and
12472	profane
12474	and
12476	for slayers of man
12477	for the sexually immoral
12478	homosexuals
12479	enslavers
12480	liars
12481	perjurers
12482	and
12483	if
12484	anything
12485	other
12486	in the
12487	being sound
12488	teaching
12489	is opposed to
12490	according to

12493	of the
12494	glory
12495	of the

12520	formerly
12521	being
12522	a blasphemer
12523	and
12524	a persecutor
12525	and
12526	insolent
12528	I was shown mercy
12529	because
12530	being ignorant
12531	I did [it]
12532	in
12533	unbelief
12534	Surpassingly increased
12535	then
12536	the
12537	grace
12538	of the

12552	and
12553	of full
12554	acceptance
12555	worthy
12556	that

12620	the
12621	going before

17126	anyone
17127	is persuaded
17128	in himself
17129	of Christ
17130	to be
17131	this
17132	let him reckon
17133	again
17135	himself
17136	that
17137	as
17138	he
17139	[is] of Christ
17140	so
17141	also [are]

17145	even
17146	for
17147	and
17148	more abundantly
17149	somewhat
17150	I should boast
17151	concerning
17152	the

17154	of us
17155	whom
17156	has given [us]

17174	to frighten
17175	you
17176	by means of
17177	the

17192	weak
17193	and
17194	the
17195	speech
17196	having been ignored
17197	This
17198	let reckon
17199	-
17200	such a one
17201	that

17237	We
17238	however
17240	into
17241	the things
17242	beyond measure
17243	will boast
17244	but
17245	according to
17246	the
17247	measure
17248	of the
17249	area
17250	that
17251	has assigned
17252	to us
17253	-

17268	ourselves
17269	as far as
17270	for
17271	also
17272	you
17273	we came
17274	in
17275	the

17310	another’s
17311	area
17312	in
17313	things
17314	ready
17315	to boast
17316	The [one]
17317	however
17318	boasting
17319	in
17320	of [the] Lord
17321	let him boast
17322	Not
17323	for
17324	the [one]
17325	himself

17328	is
17329	approved
17331	the one whom
17332	the
17333	of [the] Lord
17334	commends
17335	I wish
17336	you were bearing with
17337	me
17338	little
17339	-
17340	foolishness
17341	but
17342	indeed
17343	you do bear with
17344	me
17345	I am jealous as to
17346	for
17347	you
17348	God
17349	with [the] jealousy
17350	I have betrothed
17351	for
17352	you
17353	to one
17354	husband
17355	a virgin
17356	pure
17357	to present
17358	-
17359	to Christ
17360	I am afraid
17361	however
17363	as
17364	the
17365	serpent
17366	Eve
17367	deceived
17368	in
17369	the
17370	craftiness
17371	of him
17372	thus
17373	might be corrupted
17374	the
17375	minds
17376	of you
17377	from
17378	the
17379	simplicity
17380	-
17381	in
17382	-
17383	Christ
17384	If
17385	indeed
17386	for
17387	the [one]
17388	coming
17389	another
17390	Jesus
17391	proclaims
17392	whom
17393	not
17394	we did proclaim
17395	or
17396	a spirit
17397	different

17404	different
17405	which
17406	not
17407	you did accept
17408	well
17410	I reckon
17411	for
17412	in nothing
17413	to have been inferior
17414	to those
17416	intensely
17417	apostles
17418	If
17419	however
17420	even
17421	unpolished
17422	-
17423	in speech [I am]
17425	not

17427	in knowledge
17429	in
17430	every [way]
17432	in
17433	all things
17434	to
17435	you
17436	Or
17437	a sin
17438	did I commit
17439	myself
17440	humbling
17441	so that
17442	you
17443	might be exalted
17444	because
17445	freely
17446	the
17447	-
17448	God
17449	gospel
17450	I preached
17451	to you
17452	Other
17453	churches
17454	I robbed
17455	having received
17456	support
17457	for
17458	the
17459	toward you
17460	service
17461	And
17462	being present
17463	with
17464	you
17465	and
17466	having been in need
17467	not
17468	I did burden
17469	nothing
17470	-
17471	for
17472	the need
17473	of me
17474	completely filled up
17475	the
17476	brothers
17477	having come
17478	from
17479	Macedonia
17480	and
17481	in
17482	everything
17483	unburdensome
17484	to you
17485	me
17486	I kept
17487	and
17488	will keep
17489	Is
17490	[the] truth
17491	of Christ
17492	in
17493	me
17494	that
17495	the
17496	boasting
17497	this
17498	not
17500	of
17501	mine
17502	in
17503	the
17504	regions
17505	-
17506	of Achaia
17508	why
17509	Because
17510	not
17511	I do love
17512	you
17513	-
17514	God
17515	knows [I do]
17516	What
17517	however
17518	I do
17519	also
17520	I will do
17521	so that
17522	I might cut off
17523	the
17524	opportunity
17525	of those
17526	desiring
17527	an opportunity
17528	that
17529	in
17530	what
17531	they are boasting
17532	they might be found
17533	as
17534	also
17535	we
17536	-
17537	For
17538	such [are]
17539	false apostles
17540	workers
17541	deceitful
17542	disguising themselves
17543	as
17544	apostles
17545	of Christ
17546	And
17547	no
17548	marvelous
17549	himself
17550	for
17551	-
17552	Satan
17553	masquerades
17554	as
17555	an angel
17556	of light
17557	[It is] not
17558	surprising
17559	therefore
17560	if
17561	also
17562	the
17563	servants
17564	of him
17565	masquerade
17566	as
17567	servants
17568	of righteousness
17569	whose
17570	-
17571	end
17572	will be
17573	according to
17574	the
17575	deeds
17576	of them
17577	Again
17578	I say
17579	no
17580	one
17581	me
17582	should think
17583	a fool
17584	to be

17592	me
17593	that
17594	little
17595	a
17596	I also
17597	may boast
17598	What
17599	I am saying
17600	not

17602	in
17603	of [the] Lord

45426	churches
45427	-
45428	of Judea
45429	that [are]
45430	in
45431	Christ
45432	Only
45433	however
45434	hearing
45435	they were
45436	that
45437	the [one]
45438	persecuting
45439	us
45440	formerly
45441	now
45442	is preaching
45443	the
45444	faith
45445	which
45446	once
45447	he was destroying
45448	And
45449	they were glorifying
45450	in
45451	me
45452	-
45453	God
45454	Then
45455	after
45456	fourteen
45457	years
45458	again
45459	I went up
45460	to
45461	Jerusalem
45462	with
45465	also
45466	Titus
45467	I went up
45468	now
45469	according to
45470	a revelation
45471	and
45472	set before
45473	them
45474	the
45475	gospel
45476	that
45477	I proclaim
45478	among
45479	the
45480	Gentiles
45482	individually
45483	however
45484	to those
45485	esteemed
45487	in
45488	vain
45489	I should be running
45490	or
45491	have run
45493	not even
45494	Titus
45495	who [was]
45496	with
45497	me
45498	a Greek
45499	being
45500	was compelled
45501	to be circumcised
45502	because of
45503	even
45504	the
45505	brought in secretly
45506	false brothers
45507	who
45508	came in by stealth
45509	to spy out
45510	the
45511	freedom
45512	of us
45513	which
45514	we have
45515	in
45516	Christ
45517	Jesus
45518	that
45519	us
45521	to whom
45522	not even
45523	for
45524	an hour
45525	did we yield
45526	-
45527	in subjection
45528	so that
45529	the
45530	truth
45531	of the
45532	gospel
45533	might continue
45534	with
45535	you
45536	Of
45537	now
45538	those
45539	esteemed
45540	to be
45541	something
45543	formerly
45544	they were
45545	not
45546	to me
45547	makes a difference
45548	[the] person
45549	God
45550	of a man
45551	not
45552	does accept
45553	to me
45554	for
45555	the
45556	esteemed
45557	nothing
45558	added
45559	But
45560	on the contrary
45561	having seen
45562	that
45563	I have been entrusted with
45564	the
45565	gospel
45566	of the
45567	uncircumcision
45568	just as
45569	Peter [with that]
45570	of the
45571	circumcision
45572	the [One]
45573	for
45574	having worked
45575	in Peter
45576	for
45577	apostleship
45578	of the
45579	circumcision
45580	did
45581	also
45582	in me
45583	toward
45584	the
45585	Gentiles
45586	and
45587	having known
45588	the
45589	grace
45590	-
45591	having been given
45592	to me
45593	James
45594	and
45595	Cephas
45596	and
45598	those
45599	esteemed
45600	pillars
45601	to be
45602	[the] right hands
45603	gave
45604	to me
45605	and
45607	of fellowship
45608	that
45609	we [should go]
45610	to
45611	the
45612	Gentiles
45613	they
45614	however
45615	to
45616	the
45617	circumcision
45618	Only [they asked]
45619	the
45620	poor
45621	that
45622	we should remember
45623	that
45624	also
45625	I was eager
45626	the same
45627	thing
45628	to do
45629	When
45630	however
45631	came
45632	Peter
45633	to
45634	Antioch
45635	to
45636	face
45637	his
45638	I opposed [him]
45639	because
45640	condemned
45641	he stood
45642	Before
45643	-
45644	for
45645	came
45646	certain ones
45647	from
45648	James
45649	with
45650	the
45651	Gentiles
45652	he was eating
45653	when
45654	however
45655	they came
45656	he was drawing back
45657	and
45658	was separating
45659	himself
45660	being afraid of
45661	those
45662	of
45663	[the] circumcision
45664	And
45665	acted hypocritically
45666	with him
45667	also
45668	the
45669	rest
45670	of [the] Jews
45671	so that
45672	even
45674	was carried away
45675	of them
45676	by the
45677	hypocrisy
45679	when
45680	I saw
45681	that
45682	not
45683	they are walking uprightly
45684	according to
45685	the
45686	truth
45687	of the
45688	gospel
45689	I said
45690	-
45691	Peter
45692	before
45693	all
45694	If
45695	you
45696	a Jew
45697	being
45698	like a Gentile
45699	shall live
45700	and
45701	not
45702	like a Jew
45703	who
45704	the
45705	Gentiles
45706	do you compel
45709	by birth
45710	Jews
45711	and
45712	not
45713	of
45714	[the] Gentiles
45715	sinners
45716	knowing
45717	that
45718	not
45719	is justified
45720	a man
45721	by
45722	works
45723	of law
45724	if
45725	not
45726	through
45727	faith
45728	from Jesus
45729	Christ
45730	even
45731	we
45732	in
45733	Christ
45734	Jesus
45735	have believed
45736	that
45737	we may be justified
45738	by
45739	faith
45740	from Christ
45741	and
45742	not
45743	by
45744	works
45745	of the Law
45746	because
45747	not
45748	is justified
45749	by
45750	works
45751	of the Law
45752	any
45753	flesh
45754	If
45755	however
45756	seeking
45757	to be justified
45758	in
45759	Christ
45760	have been found
45761	also
45762	we ourselves
45763	sinners
45764	[is] then
45765	Christ
45766	of sin
45767	a minister
45768	Never
45769	may it be
45770	If
45771	for
45772	that
45773	I had torn down
45774	these things
45775	again
45776	I build
45777	a transgressor
45778	myself
45780	I
45781	for
45782	through
45783	[the] Law
45784	to [the] Law
45785	died
45786	that
45787	God
45788	I might live
45789	Christ
45790	having been crucified
45791	I live
45792	now
45793	no longer
45794	I
45795	lives
45796	however
45797	in
45798	me
45799	Christ
45800	Christ that which
45801	I have been crucified with then
45802	now
45803	I live
45804	in
45805	[the] flesh
45806	through
45807	faith
45808	I live
45809	that
45810	from the
45811	son
45812	-
45813	God
45814	the [One]
45815	having loved
45816	me
45817	and
45818	having given up
45819	Himself
45820	for
45821	me
45822	not
45823	I do set aside
45824	the
45825	grace
45826	-
45827	God
45828	if
45829	for
45830	through
45831	[the] Law
45832	righteousness [is]
45833	then
45834	Christ
45835	for naught
45836	died
45837	O
45838	foolish
45839	Galatians
45840	Who
45841	you
45842	has bewitched
45843	-
45844	[the] truth
45845	not
45846	persuaded
45847	whose
45849	eyes
45850	Jesus
45851	Christ
45852	was publicly portrayed
45853	in
45854	of you
45855	[as] having been crucified
45856	This
45857	only
45858	I wish
45859	to learn
45861	you
45862	by
45863	works
45864	of [the] Law
45865	the
45866	[the] Spirit
45867	did you receive
45868	or
45869	by
45870	hearing
45871	of faith
45872	So
45873	foolish
45874	are you
45875	Having begun
45876	[the] Spirit
45877	now
45878	in [the] flesh
45879	are you being perfected
45880	So many things
45881	did you suffer
45882	in vain
45884	also
45885	in vain
45886	The [One]
45887	therefore
45888	supplying
45889	to you
45890	the
45891	[the] Spirit
45892	and
45893	working
45894	miracles
45895	among
45896	you
45897	[is it] out of
45898	works
45899	of the Law
45900	or
45901	out of
45902	hearing
45903	of faith
45904	So also
45905	Abraham
45906	believed
45907	-
45908	God
45909	and
45910	it was reckoned
45911	to him
45912	as
45913	righteousness
45914	Know
45915	then
45916	that
45917	those
45918	of
45919	faith
45920	these
45921	are
45922	son
45923	of Abraham
45924	Having foreseen
45925	then
45926	the
45927	Scripture
45928	that
45929	by
45930	faith
45931	justifies
45932	the
45933	Gentiles
45934	-
45935	God
45936	foretold the gospel
45937	-
45938	to Abraham
45939	-
45940	Will be blessed
45941	in
45942	you
45943	all
45944	the
45945	nations
45946	So then
45947	those
45948	of
45949	faith
45950	are blessed
45951	along with
45952	the
45953	believing
45954	Abraham
45955	as many as
45956	for
45957	of
45958	works
45959	of [the] Law
45960	are

45962	a curse
45963	are
45964	it has been written
45965	for
45966	Cursed [is]
45967	everyone
45968	who
45969	not
45970	does continue
45971	in
45972	all things
45973	-
45974	having been written
45975	in
45976	the
45977	book
45978	of the
45979	Law
45980	-
45981	to do
45982	them
45983	That
45984	now
45985	by
45986	[the] law
45987	no one
45988	is justified
45989	before
45990	-
45991	God
45992	[is] evident
45993	because
45994	The
45995	righteous
45996	by
45997	faith
45998	will live
45999	-
46000	And
46001	the Law
46002	not
46003	is
46004	of
46005	faith
46007	The [one]
46008	having done
46009	these things
46010	man
46011	will live
46012	by
46013	them
46014	Christ
46015	us
46016	redeemed
46017	from
46018	the
46019	curse
46020	of the
46021	Law
46022	having become

46033	a tree
46034	so that
46035	to
46036	the
46037	Gentiles
46038	the
46039	blessing
46040	-
46041	of Abraham
46042	might come
46043	in
46044	Christ
46045	of Jesus
46046	so that
46047	the
46048	promise
46049	of the
46050	[the] Spirit
46051	we might receive
46052	through
46053	-
46054	faith
46055	Brothers
46056	according to
46057	man
46058	I am speaking
46059	Even
46060	of man

46067	-
46068	And
46069	to Abraham
46071	the
46072	promises
46073	and
46074	to the

46092	of you
46093	who
46094	is
46095	Christ
46096	This
46097	now
46098	I say
46099	[The] covenant
46100	having been confirmed beforehand
46101	by
46102	-
46103	God
46104	in

46106	-
46107	afterward
46108	years
46109	four hundred
46110	and
46111	thirty
46112	having come
46113	[the] law
46114	not
46115	does annul
46116	so as
46117	-
46118	to nullify
46119	the
46120	promise
46121	If
46122	for
46123	by
46124	[the] Law [is]
46125	the
46126	inheritance
46127	[it is] no longer
46128	by
46129	a promise
46130	-
46131	but
46132	to Abraham
46134	a promise
46135	has granted [it]
46136	-
46137	God
46138	Why
46139	then
46140	the
46141	Law
46142	-
46143	Transgressions
46144	on account of
46145	it was added
46146	until
46147	whom
46148	should have come
46149	the
46150	seed
46151	to whom
46152	promise has been made
46153	having been ordained
46155	angels
46156	in
46157	[the] hand
46158	of a mediator
46159	-
46160	However
46161	a mediator
46162	of one [person]
46163	not
46164	is
46165	-
46166	but
46167	God
46168	one
46169	is
46170	-
46171	therefore
46172	Law
46173	[is] contrary to
46174	the
46175	promises
46176	-
46177	God
46178	Never
46179	may it be
46180	If
46181	for
46182	had been given
46183	a law
46184	-
46185	being able
46187	indeed
46188	-
46189	from out of
46190	[the] Law
46191	would have emerged
46192	-
46193	righteousness
46194	but
46195	imprisoned
46196	the
46197	Scripture
46198	things
46199	all
46200	under
46201	sin
46202	so that
46203	the
46204	promise
46205	by
46206	faith
46207	from Jesus
46208	Christ
46209	might be given
46210	to those

46228	the

46230	trainer
46231	of us
46232	has become
46233	unto
46234	Christ
46235	so that
46236	by

46238	we might be justified
46239	Having come

46264	you have put on
46265	Neither
46266	there is
46267	Jew
46268	nor
46269	Greek
46270	neither
46271	there is

46283	one
46284	are
46285	in
46286	Christ
46287	Jesus
46288	If
46289	now
46290	you [are]

46297	and
46299	[the] promise
46300	heirs
46301	I say
46302	now
46304	as long as
46305	time
46306	the
46307	heir
46308	a child
46309	is
46310	not
46311	he differs
46312	from a slave
46313	[though] owner
46314	of everything
46315	being
46316	Instead
46317	under

46322	until
46323	the
46324	time appointed

46326	father
46327	So
46328	also
46329	we
46330	when
46331	we were
46332	children
46333	under
46334	the
46335	basic principles
46336	of the
46337	world
46338	came about
46339	held in bondage
46340	When
46341	however
46342	had come
46343	the
46344	fullness
46345	of the
46346	time
46347	sent forth
46348	-
46349	God
46350	the

46352	of him
46353	having been born
46354	of
46355	a woman
46356	having been born
46357	under
46358	[the] Law
46359	that
46360	those
46361	under
46362	[the] Law
46363	He might redeem
46364	so that
46365	the
46366	divine adoption as sons
46367	we might receive
46368	Because
46369	now
46370	you are
46371	sons
46372	sent forth
46373	-
46374	God
46375	the
46376	[the] Spirit
46377	of the
46378	son
46379	of Him
46380	into
46381	the
46382	hearts
46383	of you
46384	crying out
46386	-
46387	father
46388	So
46389	no longer
46390	you are
46391	a slave
46393	a son
46394	if
46395	now
46396	a son
46397	also
46398	an heir
46399	God
46400	through
46401	Christ
46402	But
46403	at that time
46404	indeed
46405	not
46406	knowing
46407	God
46408	you were enslaved
46409	to those
46410	not
46411	nature
46412	being
46413	gods
46414	now
46415	however
46416	having known
46417	God
46418	rather
46419	however
46420	having been known
46421	by
46422	God
46423	how
46424	do you turn
46425	again
46426	to
46427	the
46428	weak
46429	and
46430	destitute
46431	principles

46486	you did despise [me]
46487	nor
46488	reject [me] with contempt
46490	as
46491	an angel
46492	God
46493	you received
46494	me
46495	even as
46496	Christ
46497	Jesus
46498	who
46499	then
46501	the

46503	of you
46504	I bear witness
46505	for
46506	to you
46507	that
46508	if

46711	was persecuting
46712	the [one born]

46715	so
46716	also
46717	[it is] now
46718	But
46719	what
46720	says
46721	the

47834	whom
47835	to Me
47836	has given
47837	-
47838	God
47839	Since
47840	therefore
47841	the
47842	children
47843	have partaken
47844	of flesh
47845	and
47846	blood
47847	also
47848	He
47849	likewise
47850	took part in
47851	the
47852	same things
47853	so that
47854	through
47855	[His]

47956	These things
47957	than
47959	has been counted worthy
47961	so much as
47962	greater
47963	honor
47964	has
47965	than the
47966	house [itself]
47967	the [one]
47968	having built

47970	Every

47973	is built
47974	by
47975	someone
47976	the [One]
47977	however
47978	-
47979	everything
47980	having built [is]
47981	God
47982	And
47983	Moses
47984	indeed
47985	[was] faithful
47986	in
47987	all
47988	the
47989	house
47990	of Him
47991	as
47992	a servant
47993	unto
47994	a testimony
47995	of the things
47996	going to be spoken
47997	Christ
47998	however
47999	as
48000	[the] Son
48001	over
48002	the
48003	house
48004	of Him
48005	whose
48006	house
48007	are
48008	we
48009	if indeed
48010	[our]
48011	confidence
48012	and
48013	the
48014	boast
48015	of [our]
48016	hope
48017	unto
48018	[the] end
48019	firm
48020	we should hold
48021	Therefore
48022	just as
48023	says
48024	the
48025	[the] Spirit
48026	-
48027	Holy
48028	Today
48029	if
48030	the
48031	voice
48032	of Him
48033	you should hear
48034	not
48035	harden
48036	the
48037	hearts
48038	of you
48039	as
48040	in
48041	the
48042	rebellion
48043	in
48044	the
48045	day
48046	-
48047	of testing
48048	in
48049	the
48050	wilderness
48051	where
48052	tried [Me]
48053	us
48054	the
48055	fathers
48056	of you
48058	us
48059	and
48060	saw
48061	the
48062	works
48063	of Me
48065	years
48066	Therefore
48067	I was angry
48068	with the
48069	generation
48070	those
48071	and
48072	I said
48073	Always
48074	they go astray
48075	-
48076	in the heart
48077	of them
48078	and
48079	not
48080	have they known
48081	the
48082	ways
48083	of Me
48084	so
48085	I swore
48086	in
48087	the
48088	wrath
48089	of Me
48090	[not]
48091	shall they enter
48092	into
48093	the
48094	rest
48095	of Me
48096	looking upon
48097	brothers
48099	there will be
48100	in
48101	any
48102	of you
48103	a heart
48104	evil
48105	of unbelief
48106	into
48107	-
48108	falling away
48109	from
48110	God
48111	[the] living
48112	But
48113	encourage
48114	other
48116	every
48117	day
48118	while
48119	-
48120	-
48121	today
48122	it is called
48123	so that
48124	not
48125	may be hardened
48126	one
48127	of
48128	you
48129	by [the] deceitfulness
48130	-
48131	of sin
48132	Partakers
48133	for
48134	has come to pass
48135	-
48136	of Christ
48137	if indeed
48138	from the
48139	beginning
48140	the
48141	assurance
48142	unto
48143	[the] end
48144	firm
48145	we should hold
48146	As
48147	-
48148	it is said
48149	Today
48150	if
48151	the
48152	voice
48153	of Him
48154	you should hear
48155	not
48156	harden
48157	the
48158	hearts
48159	of you
48160	as
48161	in
48162	the
48163	rebellion
48164	Who
48165	for
48166	[were those] having heard
48167	rebelled
48169	not
48170	all
48171	those
48172	having come
48173	out of
48174	Egypt
48175	by the leading of
48177	With whom
48178	now
48179	was He indignant
48181	years
48182	[if] not
48183	with those
48184	having sinned
48185	whose
48186	-
48187	bodies
48188	fell
48189	in
48190	the
48191	wilderness
48192	To whom
48193	then
48194	did He swear that
48195	not
48196	shall they enter
48197	into
48198	the
48199	rest
48200	of Him
48201	if
48202	not
48203	to those
48204	having disobeyed
48205	And
48206	we see
48207	that
48208	not
48209	they were able
48210	to enter in
48212	unbelief
48214	therefore
48216	left remaining
48217	of the promise
48218	to enter
48219	into
48220	the
48221	rest
48222	of Him
48223	should seem
48224	any
48225	of
48226	you
48227	to have fallen short
48228	And
48229	for
48230	we are [those]
48231	having had the gospel preached
48232	just as
48233	they [did]
48235	not
48236	did profit
48237	the
48238	message
48239	of [their]
48240	hearing
48241	them
48242	not
48244	the
48245	faith
48246	of those
48247	having heard
48249	for
48250	into
48251	the
48252	rest
48253	those
48254	having believed
48255	as
48256	He has said
48257	So
48258	I swore
48259	in
48260	the
48261	wrath
48262	of me
48263	Not
48264	shall they enter
48265	into
48266	the
48267	rest
48268	of Me
48269	And yet
48270	the
48271	works
48272	from
48273	[the] foundation
48274	of [the] world
48275	have been finished
48276	He has spoken
48277	for
48278	somewhere
48279	concerning
48280	the
48281	seventh [day]
48282	in this way
48283	And
48284	rested
48285	-
48286	God
48287	on
48288	the
48289	day
48290	-
48291	seventh
48292	from
48293	all
48294	the
48295	works
48296	of Him
48297	And
48298	in
48299	this [passage]
48300	again
48301	[Not]
48302	shall they enter
48303	into
48304	the
48305	rest
48306	of Me
48307	Since
48308	therefore
48309	it remains [for]
48310	some
48311	to enter
48312	into
48313	it
48314	and
48315	those
48316	formerly
48317	having received the good news
48318	not
48319	did enter in
48321	disobedience
48322	again
48323	a certain
48324	He appoints
48325	day
48326	Today
48327	through
48329	saying
48330	after
48331	so long
48332	a time
48333	just as
48335	Today
48336	if
48337	the
48338	voice
48339	of Him
48340	you shall hear
48341	not
48342	harden
48343	the
48344	hearts
48345	of you
48346	If
48347	for
48348	to them
48349	Joshua
48350	had given rest
48351	not
48352	-
48353	about
48354	another
48355	He would have spoken
48356	after
48357	this
48358	day
48359	So then
48360	there remains
48361	a Sabbath rest
48362	for the
48363	people
48364	-
48365	God
48366	The [one]
48367	for
48368	having entered
48369	into
48370	the
48371	rest
48372	of Him
48373	also
48374	he
48375	rested
48376	from
48377	the
48378	works
48379	of him
48380	as
48381	from
48382	the

48387	therefore
48388	to enter
48389	into
48390	that
48391	-
48392	rest
48393	so that
48394	not
48395	by
48396	the
48397	same
48398	anyone
48399	example
48400	should fall
48401	-
48402	of disobedience
48403	Living [is]
48404	for
48405	the
48406	word
48407	-
48408	God
48409	and
48410	active
48411	and
48412	sharper
48413	than

48430	able to judge
48431	[the] thoughts
48432	and
48433	intentions
48434	of [the] heart
48435	And
48436	not
48437	there is
48438	creature
48439	hidden
48440	before
48441	Him
48442	all things
48443	however
48444	[are] uncovered
48445	and
48446	laid bare
48447	to the

48449	of Him
48450	to
48451	whom
48452	[is] our

48454	reckoning
48455	Having
48456	therefore
48457	a high priest
48458	great
48459	having passed through
48460	the

48462	Jesus
48463	the
48464	son
48465	-
48466	God
48467	we should hold firmly
48468	to [our]
48469	confession
48470	Not
48471	for
48472	have we
48473	a high priest
48474	not

48479	of us
48481	however
48482	in
48483	all things
48485	the same way
48486	without
48487	sin
48488	We should come

48491	boldness
48492	to the
48493	throne
48494	-
48495	of grace

48501	may find
48502	for

48541	just as
48542	for
48543	the

108450	the
108451	son
108452	of
108453	Man
108454	And
108455	having departed
108456	from there
108457	He went
108458	into
108459	the
108460	synagogue
108461	of them
108462	And
108463	behold
108464	a man
108465	came about
108466	-
108467	a hand
108468	having
108469	withered
108470	And
108471	they asked
108472	Him
108473	saying
108474	Is
108475	it lawful
108476	on the
108477	Sabbaths
108478	healing
108479	so that
108480	they might accuse
108481	Him
108482	-
108483	And
108484	He said
108485	to them
108486	What

108490	man
108491	who
108492	will have
108493	sheep
108494	one
108495	and
108496	if
108497	falls
108498	it
108499	on the
108500	Sabbaths
108501	into
108502	a pit

108504	will he take hold of
108505	it
108506	and
108507	will raise [it] up
108508	How much
108509	therefore
108510	is more valuable
108511	a man
108512	than a sheep
108513	Therefore
108514	it is lawful
108515	on the
108516	Sabbaths
108517	good
108518	to do
108519	Then
108520	He says
108521	to

108523	having stretched out
108524	-
108525	hand
108526	of you

108535	the
108536	then
108537	Pharisees
108538	a counsel
108539	held
108541	Him
108542	will go forth
108543	how
108544	Him
108545	they might destroy
108546	-
108547	And
108548	Jesus
108549	having known
108550	withdrew
108551	from there
108552	And
108553	followed
108554	Him
108555	crowds
108556	great
108557	and
108558	He healed
108559	them
108560	all
108561	and
108562	He warned
108563	them
108564	that
108565	not
108566	known
108567	Him
108568	they should make
108569	so that
108570	might be fulfilled
108571	that
108572	having been spoken
108573	by
108574	Isaiah
108575	the

108592	of Me
108593	I will put
108594	the
108595	[the] Spirit
108596	of Me
108598	Him
108599	and
108600	justice
108601	to the
108602	Gentiles
108603	He will proclaim
108604	Not
108605	will He quarrel
108606	nor
108607	will he cry out
108608	nor
108609	will hear
108610	anyone

138888	that
138889	nothing [is]

138893	if
138894	not
138895	to him
138896	reckoning
138897	anything
138898	unclean
138899	to be
138900	to that one
138901	unclean [it is]
138902	If
138903	then
138904	on account of
138905	food
138906	the
138907	brother
138908	of you
138909	is grieved
138910	no longer
138911	according to
138912	love
138913	are you walking
138914	Not
138915	with the

138917	of you
138918	that one
138919	destroy

138922	Christ
138923	died
138924	Not
138925	let be spoken of as evil
138926	therefore
138927	your

138932	is
138933	the
138934	kingdom
138935	-
138936	God

138938	and
138939	drinking
138940	but
138941	righteousness
138942	and
138943	peace
138944	and
